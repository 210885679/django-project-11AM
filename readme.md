This project is carefully built on the Django framework, integrating three core functional modules, and aims to provide strong support for the development of educational management and service-oriented enterprise portals. Its functional module design is comprehensive and practical. Whether it is the efficient integration of educational resources, the fine management of personnel information, or the online display and interaction of service projects, it can be easily handled, helping enterprises and educational institutions to stand out in digital operation and realize the efficient and intelligent transformation of business processes.

## ‚ú® Core Modules

### 1. Course student management (coursestudent)
- **Information management background**: Provide a comprehensive management background of curriculum and student information, which is convenient for managers to efficiently enter, query and update relevant information to ensure the accuracy and integrity of data.
- **Course list display**: Through the course list display page (/coursestudent/), the basic information of all courses, including course names, teachers, class times, etc., is intuitively displayed, which is convenient for students and parents to quickly browse the course schedule.
- **Fee and related viewing**: On the student fee and course related viewing page (/coursestudent/stuinfo/), students' payment status and detailed related information of selected courses are clearly displayed, making cost management and course selection more transparent.
### 2. Visitor service (guestapp)
- **Information collection form**: The design of a simple and easy-to-use student information collection form is used to quickly and accurately collect the personal data of visiting students and provide basic data support for subsequent communication and services.
- **Digital calculator function**: built-in practical digital calculator function, which can meet the simple calculation needs of daily teaching and management and improve work efficiency.
- **HTTP response demonstration**: Provide basic HTTP response demonstration to help technicians and non-technical personnel better understand the data interaction process in Web development, and facilitate system integration and function expansion.

### 3. Parent portal (parentsapp)
- **Responsive enterprise portal**: Build a responsive enterprise portal to ensure that parents can get a good access experience on various devices (such as mobile phones, tablets, computers) and keep abreast of the latest developments of schools and enterprises anytime and anywhere.
- **User registration/login system**: a perfect user registration/login system ensures the security of parents' accounts, and provides personalized service entrances for parents to facilitate their access to educational information related to their children.
